## 🔧 Configuration

### Account Settings
Edit the account credentials in `final.py`:
```python
ACCOUNT = {"email": "your-email@gmail.com", "password": "your-password"}
```

### Proxy Settings
The script uses 3 rotating proxy servers. Update in `final.py`:
```python
PROXIES = [
    {
        "server": "http://your-proxy:port",
        "username": "your-username", 
        "password": "your-password"
    }
]
```

### Customization
- **Products to Browse**: Modify `search_terms` in `browse_random_products_WORKING()`
- **Wishlist Name**: Auto-generated with timestamp, or customize in `run_FINAL_COMPLETE_automation()`
- **Human Delays**: Adjust timing in `human_delay()` and `human_like_delay()` functions

## 🎉 Success Indicators

When running, you'll see:
```
[SUCCESS] Wishlist Creation - ✅ Wishlist 'Your List Name' CONFIRMED CREATED!
[SUCCESS] Browsing - Successfully browsed product 1/3
[SUCCESS] Add Product - 🎉 SUCCESS! Product added - indicator: [selector]
[SUCCESS] Test - 🎉🎉🎉 COMPLETE SUCCESS: ALL PHASES WORKING PERFECTLY! 🎉🎉🎉
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Proxy Timeouts**: Try running without proxy first by commenting out `proxy=proxy_config`
2. **Login Required**: Delete session files in `sessions/` folder to force re-login
3. **Element Not Found**: Amazon may have updated - check screenshots in `screenshots/` folder

### Debug Mode
The script automatically:
- Takes screenshots at key steps
- Saves detailed logs to `FINAL_COMPLETE_log.json`
- Saves page HTML when errors occur
